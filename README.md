This is the Xibo Message Relay (XMR) repository.

XMR is a php application built on ReactPHP which acts as a ZeroMQ message exchange between the Xibo CMS and connected
Xibo Players. It doesn't do anything beyond forward messages from the CMS to a pub/sub socket.

It is packaged into a PHAR file which is included in the [Xibo CMS](https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms) release 
files.

## Installation
